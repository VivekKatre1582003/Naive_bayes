# Naive_bayes
This repository implements a Naive Bayes classifier on the Iris dataset, a popular dataset in machine learning. The dataset contains 150 iris flowers from three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, with each flower described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
